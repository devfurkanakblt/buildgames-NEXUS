**STEP 1: Project Setup & Mock ERC20**

Please generate the following:
1. The basic Hardhat (or Foundry) configuration for an Avalanche project targeting the Fuji Testnet.
2. A simple `MockUSDC.sol` ERC20 token contract using OpenZeppelin. It should mint 10,000 tokens to the deployer upon creation. This will act as our stablecoin for the MVP.
